Rhapsodii Shima 5.5.4

Changes:
- Updated installation and configuration instruction. Make sure to read them before asking for help.
- Theme .ini is updated with the new WFL 5.5.4 features. File is now smaller and easier to maintain for future WFL updates.
- Renewed source menu icons, for a cleaner and more consistent look.
- Fixed text size and camera angles in coverflows for a more solid feel during transitions.
- Reworked some cover animations.
- Improved background and cover layout mode 2 for PC Dos/Win.
- Replaced gear icon with the plugin icon in the Source Menu Setup sub sections.
- Renewed the Handhelds Sourceflow page with a more realistic dot-matrix title.
- Reworked support for regional consoles versions. If you used TURBOGRAFX or TURBODUO you have to set them up again. See 'Regional configurations.txt' for instructions.
- Added initial support for Japanese covers with different box size (Famicom, Super Famicom, GB/GBC, Game Gear). 
- Platform.ini includes all the latest Plugin Pack updates.
- Cleaned up redundant platforms from platform.ini.
- Cleaned up unused coverflows.
- Added an alternate "stripe" sourceflow with a smaller size (showing 5 buttons instead of 3). See'instructions.txt' for configuration.
- Removed Nintendo DS backgrounds and buttons. NDS emulation is still embrional on the Wii, I'll add it again when/if games will run at a playable state. NDS it's still in platform.ini for future use.
