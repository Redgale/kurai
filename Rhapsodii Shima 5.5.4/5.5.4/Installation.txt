Rhapsodii Shima - by PRP "Tetsuo"
A theme for Wiiflow Lite in 16:9 aspect ratio


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Wiiflow Lite 5.5.4 or above
30 MB of disk space on your storage device


UPDATING FROM OLDER VERSIONS
----------------------------
Backup your source menu .ini files in wiiflow/source_menu/Rhapsodii Shima if you made some changes, or they will be overwritten with the default ones.

Delete these folders, before updating:
wiiflow/backgrounds/Rhapsodii Shima/
wiiflow/source_menu/Rhapsodii Shima/
wiiflow/themes_lite/Rhapsodii Shima/

Install the package, run Wiiflow and Reload Cache


INSTALLATION
------------
Extract and copy the 'wiiflow' folder to the root of the device where Wiiflow is installed. 
Merge all folders and overwrite all files when requested.
Rhapsodii Shima and Rhapsodii Shima SDTV are two separate themes. They can be installed side by side without any conflicts.


THEME SETUP
-----------
1) Set your Wii console to 16:9 aspect ratio.

2) Set your TV to 16:9.

3) Launch Wiiflow and go to Settings (gear icon) at page 2. Change Theme to 'Rhapsodii Shima'.


THEME CONFIGURATION
-------------------
1) Activating Wheel and Stripe menus (Sourceflow mode):
- Go to Wiiflow settings page 12 and click on the 'Sourceflow Settings' button. 
- Set 'Enable Sourceflow' and 'Sourceflow Smallbox' to 'On'.
- Set 'Box Mode' to 'Off'.
You're not forced to use Sourceflow. Turn it off for the classic style view (icons on a 4x3 grid).

2) To use the correct Homebrew layout (apps on a 3x3 grid):
- Go to Settings page 12 and click on 'Homebrew Settings'. 
- Turn 'Coverflow Smallbox' to 'On' and 'Box Mode' to 'Off'.
- Go to Settings page 13 and set 'Lock coverflow layouts' to 'Off'. 
- Return to your Homebrew flow and press 1 or 2 on the Wiimote until you see your apps on a 3x3 grid. 
- Set 'Lock coverflow layouts' to 'On'.

3) In the same way, you can also choose between 3 alternate layouts for standard DVD boxes (Wii, GC, Nand, Arcade, etc.)

4) To use the alternate (smaller) stripe layout in sourceflow mode:
- Open the source menu .ini files (arcades.ini, consoles.ini, ...) in wiiflow/source_menu/Rhapsodii Shima/ 
- Scroll all the way down to the [GENERAL] section and change:
flow=3
to:
flow=2
See the included 'Coverflows_reference_chart.txt' for info on multiple layouts

5) To display a console from a different region (USA/EUR/JAP) and its game boxes with the proper size:
Follow instructions in 'Regional Configuration.txt'
N.B.: There are still no japanese covers sets available for Wiiflow at the moment, I just added support for them.


PLUGINS CONFIGURATION
---------------------
Use the Source Menu Setup:
- Enter one of the 5 main tiers (Wii menu, Retro Consoles etc...) then press the Home button to access the Source Menu Setup. 
- You can Hide source buttons, link source buttons to plugins and set plugins ROMs paths.
To change other settings like coverfolder or filetypes you have to manually edit the .ini files found in wiiflow/plugins


NOTES
-----
- To be fully appreciated, this theme should be used in conjunction with Wiiflow's Database and Snapshots by Wiimpathy.
IMPORTANT: The Database includes an outdated platform.ini file that will break some of the theme's features if you ovewrite it. Copy again the platform.ini file included in this pack, if you overwrited it by mistake.
- Platform.ini is an integral part of Wiiflow. Editing this file is not needed by this theme, nor encouraged. Edit at your own risk.
- The CreateCat application is also recommended to have separate and pre-compiled categories for wii/gc and plugin games, according to the database.
